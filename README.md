The Multimodal Learning for Earth and Environment Workshop (MultiEarth 2023) is the second annual CVPR workshop aimed at leveraging the significant amount of remote sensing data that is continuously being collected to aid in the monitoring and analysis of the health of Earth ecosystems. Detailed information, including public challenge data download links, can be found on the workshopâ€™s webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/rainforest-challenge. The goal of the workshop is to bring together the Earth and environmental science communities as well as the multimodal representation learning communities to examine new ways to leverage technological advances in support of environmental monitoring. In addition, through a series of public challenges, the MultiEarth Workshop hopes to provide a common benchmark for remote sensing multimodal information processing. There are two main categories of public challenges as part of the MultiEarth Workshop
